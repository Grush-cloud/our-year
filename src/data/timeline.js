    title: "The Day We Met",
    description: "The day we got our postings, we went to HR to fill our assumption of duty forms. I remember you were sitting one seat away from me. You and the person next to me were talking a lot about different things, and at some point I heard you mention something about being the PA to the Director of ACTU. From that moment, I figured out you were Grace, because I had already seen everyone’s postings for ACTU. Eventually, we started talking properly. Later on, we found out that our boss wasn’t around, so we were told to come back another day when he returned from his travels. After that, we went our separate ways to our various car parks.",

So I quickly texted you, fingers crossed. You stayed with me — chatting through all my text bombardments — and you helped me sort out everything I needed concerning NELFUND.",

    description: "When you randomly asked me 'What do you want for dinner?' I was confused and didn’t think much of it so I said 'fries and wings', told my people about it and we all brushed it off, then you actually showed up and we were all in shock — that became a core memory for me.",

    description: "So much happened after the fries and wings day — the confusion, the denials — but I pushed myself because I wanted at least one day out with you before you left; we went to that private cinema, watched a Nigerian movie, I hesitated to kiss you there, then outside your estate gate while holding you I thought I’d regret it if I didn’t try even with the distance, so we had our first kiss on the street, I went home smiling like a fool and even tipped the driver 10k that night.",

    description: "I was ready — I didn’t want you to just go like that and I didn’t want not to try even though the distance was a hurdle to figure out, so I set it up and asked you to be my girlfriend, and what a day it was, a success — I could finally say I’m your boyfriend, and that’s how our journey began.",
